## About our project

The Library of Open Source Hardware was created by the [OPEN!NEXT](https://opennext.eu/) working group. They are a team of institutions and organizations that support the growth of Open Source hardware. Tasked by the [European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/869984) to create a consolidated database for Open Source Hardware specifications, the OPEN!NEXT working group created this library for use by the maker community.

These organizations are part of the working group:
- [Wikimedia Germany](https://wikimedia.de)
- [Fraunhofer IPK]()
- [TU Berlin]()
- [Wikifactory]()

### Our mission

1. Development of standards for the open source community to enable sharing and reuse of data and hardware
2. Providing an accessible open source database that allows for easy exploration of the stored data and guides makers in contributing their open source hardware specifications.
