Our library of Open Source Hardware data thrives on participation. We want to make it as easy as possible for your open source hardware specifications to be collected and shared.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting your hardware specifications included in our library:

### 1. Download the Template

[Download template file](somelink)

Click on “Download template file” button to download your copy of the template. It will save the file in your downloads folder

### 2. Add your data

With a text editor, open the downloaded template and adjust it to match your hardware’s specifications. Make sure it has the proper file ending (yourfile.**osh**) and follows the [specifications](somelink) of osh files.

### 3. Upload your data to a repository

- Create an account with [Github.com](https://www.github.com) or [Gitlab.com](https://www.gitlab.com) OR sign in to your existing [Github.com](https://www.github.com) or [Gitlab.com](https://www.gitlab.com) account
- Add your specification file to an existing repository or create a new repository
- Commit and push your changes of the file to the remote repository on gitlab or github.

### 4. Wait for your specifications to be picked up

Our crawler service will periodically go  through repositories with osh-files and pick up your specifications.

### 5. Update your specifications

If you need to make changes to your specs, edit the file in your repository and push the changes. The crawler will pick up the changes.
