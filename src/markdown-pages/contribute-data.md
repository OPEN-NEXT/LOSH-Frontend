Our library of Open Source Hardware data thrives on participation. We want to make it as easy as possible for your open source hardware specifications to be collected and shared.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting your hardware specifications included in our library:

## How to submit your specification

### **1. Download the Template**

[Download template file](somelink)

Click on “Download template file” button to retrieve your copy of the template. It will save the file in your designated downloads folder

### **2. Add your data**

With a simple text editor, open the downloaded template and adjust it to match your specifications. Make sure it has the proper file type/ending (yourfile.osh) and follows the [specifications](somelink) of XYZ files.

### **3. Upload your data to a repository**

- Create an account with [Github.com](https://www.github.com)
- OR sign in to your existing [Github.com](https://www.github.com) account
- Add your specification file to an existing repository or create a new repository
- Commit and push your changes of the file to the remote repository.

### **4. Wait for your specifications to be picked up**

Our crawler service will periodically sift through repositories with the requisite file name and structure and pick up your specifications at the next opportunity.

### **5. Check your specifications**

Share your specifications or update your specifications with new changes.
